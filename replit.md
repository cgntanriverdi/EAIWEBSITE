## System Architecture
The application is built as a full-stack web application with a React frontend and an Express.js backend, both written in TypeScript.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
The design adheres to a Stripe-inspired professional aesthetic, featuring:
- Navy blue gradient hero sections with realistic UI mockups for agent pages.
- Alternating white and light gray (`#F7F4F0`) backgrounds for sections.
- Minimalistic icon treatments (stroke-only with ring borders).
- Large typographic metrics and generous whitespace.
- Subtle shadows for professional elevation.
- Clear hierarchy in typography and a color palette primarily using Stripe navy (`#0A2540`) and indigo accents (`#4F46E5`).
- Responsive design with dark/light mode support.

**Technical Implementations:**
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Vite for build, Wouter for routing, Shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS for UI, TanStack Query for server state management, and React Hook Form with Zod for form validation.
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript, supporting API endpoints for pricing plans, leads, and sales inquiries.
- **Storage**: In-memory storage (MemStorage) is the default, with a DatabaseStorage class supporting PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM and `node-postgres` for persistent data.
- **Feature Specifications**:
    - **AI Agents**: Dedicated pages for Description, Image Generation, Pricing, and Publishing agents, each with unique mockups and features.
    - **Pricing Plans**: Management of Basic, Pro, Plus, and Enterprise plans with subscription tracking.
    - **Contact Forms**: Functionality for lead generation and enterprise sales inquiries.
    - **Real-time Updates**: Achieved through TanStack Query.
    - **Onboarding Tutorial**: Interactive tutorial with rainbow gradient design that appears for new users on their first dashboard visit. Features:
        - Multi-step guided tour with smooth animations
        - Spotlight highlighting of specific dashboard sections
        - Rainbow gradient header animation matching signup page aesthetic
        - Progress indicators and skip functionality
        - Persistent state management via localStorage to prevent repeat displays

**System Design Choices:**
- The application is configured for seamless deployment on Replit, with Node.js v20, npm dependency management, and specific port and host configurations.
- The project structure separates client, server, and shared code for modularity.
- Development uses Hot Module Replacement (HMR) via Vite.
