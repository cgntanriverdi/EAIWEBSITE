# Design Guidelines: AI E-Commerce SaaS Landing Page

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach** - Drawing inspiration from premium SaaS leaders (huly.io, cluely.com, autods.com) while creating a unique signature brand identity that avoids generic template aesthetics.

## Signature Brand Aesthetic System

### Color Palette
**Primary Gradient**: 250 85% 15% â†’ 220 100% 50% (deep purple to electric blue)
**Accent Gold**: 45 90% 65% (used sparingly for CTAs and highlights)
**Dark Mode Base**: 240 15% 8% (rich charcoal)
**Light Surfaces**: 240 20% 98% (near white with subtle purple tint)
**Text Hierarchy**: 240 10% 95% / 240 15% 75% / 240 25% 45%

### Typography
**Primary**: Inter or Satoshi (modern, geometric)
**Display**: Custom weight hierarchy - 700 for heroes, 600 for sections, 500 for body
**Sizing Scale**: Use Tailwind units 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 for consistent spacing

### Shape Language
**Organic Flow**: Soft, flowing curves for background elements and card borders
**Precision Geometry**: Sharp, clean lines for data visualization and technical components
**Floating Elements**: Subtle elevation with branded shadow system using purple-tinted shadows

### Motion Style
**Staggered Reveals**: Elements appear with 100ms delays between related items
**Floating Particles**: Subtle animated background particles with gradient colors
**Hover Transformations**: Gentle scale (1.02) and glow effects on interactive elements
**Scroll Parallax**: Background elements move at 0.5x speed for depth

## Layout System
**Spacing Primitives**: Consistent use of Tailwind units 2, 4, 8, 16 for margins and padding
**Grid Structure**: 12-column responsive grid with generous gutters
**Section Rhythm**: Alternating full-width and contained sections for visual breathing

## Component Library

## Critical Design Constraints
**Maximum 5 Sections**: Hero, Problem/Solution, Agent Showcase, Workflow Demo, Pricing + CTA
**Single Viewport Focus**: Primary value proposition immediately visible
**Premium Aesthetics**: Every element crafted with intentional beauty and brand consistency
**Non-Generic Identity**: Signature visual elements that distinguish from template designs

## Images
**Hero Background**: Abstract gradient visualization with floating geometric particles
**Agent Icons**: Custom-designed pictographic icons for each AI agent function
**Workflow Diagram**: Clean, technical illustration showing process flow with branded styling
**No Large Hero Image**: Focus on dynamic gradient backgrounds and signature visual elements instead

The design should feel like a million-dollar SaaS brand with every detail reinforcing the unique visual identity while maintaining the premium standards of industry leaders.
